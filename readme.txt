Enable the new WordPress block editor for Easy Digital Downloads products.

== Description ==

This plugin enables the new WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor for the Easy Digital Downloads post type. Or any other plugin or theme that uses a custom post type "download".

The block editor is not guaranteed compatible with EDD and all it's extensions yet but testing so far has _not_ revealed any issues with these plugins:

* Easy Digital Downloads
* Easy Digital Downloads - Software Licensing
* Easy Digital Downloads - External Products
* Easy Digital Downloads - Invoices
* Easy Digital Downloads - Manual Purchases
* Easy Digital Downloads - Recurring Payments
* Easy Digital Downloads - Sales Recovery
* Easy Digital Downloads - Stripe Payment Gateway

If you find any incompatibilities, please let me know on the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/edd-gutenberg). And also if you find this plugin to be compatible with a plugin not in this list yet.
